# ML_Task_1---CC_Pre-recruitment

Work flow of this project

1. Initially, I have done basic cleaning of data set. For this I mmade two files
  # primary_cleaning.py and EDA_Cleaning.ipynb
  .py file is code and .nb is for determining cleaning.

2. Feature Selection
   Check files (features.py and EDA_Analysis and FE.ipynb)
   features.py is code and .nb is for determining which features are to be selected

3. Model Selection and Hyperparameter tuning
   check file main.ipynb

   I have selected "GBregressor" as it gives less rmse and data is also not strongly linearly related
   For hyperparameter tuning I have used GridSearchCV as it automates process

That's It
Check predictions.csv for predictions on test file
